# WORK IN PROGRESS

## What is this?

This is a remake of the [original HTML5 Clear](https://raw.github.com/yyx990803/HTML5-Clear).

The original iphone app by Realmac: [http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/)


## What's New?

- Local storage!
- More robust structure
- More robust touch events handling
- More features such as long drag up/down (WIP)
- Better pinch (WIP)

## And More Importantly...

This time there is a new reason for doing this again. When I made the original HTML5 Clear, I simply wanted to build something shiny in a short time. The vimeo video covered up most of the bugs, unstableness and dirtiness underneath. It also missed quite some beautiful details of the original iOS app.

So for this version, by adding a lot more visual/motion details and multi-touch gestures, the purpose is two fold:

1. To challenge my own technical limits;
2. To show (partly to myself) that HTML5 can achieve amazing level of details if you really want to.

## Build Dependency

Node.js and UglifyJS
